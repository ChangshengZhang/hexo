My name is Changsheng Zhang(张昌盛), an undergraduate student at Tsinghua University majoring in Automation, where students are expected to learn control theories, computer science and electrics.

Asset management is my passion. Conducting research in public companies and seeking alpha strategies are my daily activities. To get a taste of this, please refer to my relative [blogs](http://glennzhang.com/categories/Investment/)
