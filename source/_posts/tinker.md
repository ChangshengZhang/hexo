## RoboCup@Home

The RoboCup@Home league aims to develop service and assistive robot technology with high relevance for future personal domestic applications. It is the largest international annual competition for autonomous service robots and is part of the RoboCup initiative. A set of benchmark tests is used to evaluate the robots' abilities and performance in a realistic non-standardized home environment setting. Focus lies on the following domains but is not limited to: Human-Robot-Interaction and Cooperation, Navigation and Mapping in dynamic environments, Computer Vision and Object Recognition under natural light conditions, Object Manipulation, Adaptive Behaviors, Behavior Integration, Ambient Intelligence, Standardization and System Integration. It is colocated with the RoboCup symposium.

## Tinker

Tinker is developed by FuRoC (Future Robotics Club), which is a student group in Tsinghua University focusing on robotics, AI and related areas. We use tinker to participation in the RoboCup@Home Competition. Tinker is designed to be an autonomous humanoid robot mainly for home services.
